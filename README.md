# python-game
Working on a small project in python using Pygame for schoolfriends as a learning project

Requires Python3 and pygame to run

To install pygame (if python3 is installed):

-run command prompt

-Type 'pip install pygame'


If the error occurs "cannot find ...res/'sprite'/png", delete anything before 'res/' in the path strings (I am hardpathing to let me run my project in notepad++), if the the error persists, message me with the error and I'll take a look.
