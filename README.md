# python-game
Working on a small project in python using Pygame for school as a learning project.

Requires Python3 and pygame to run

To install pygame (if python3 is installed):
-run command prompt
-Type 'pip install pygame'

If the error occurs "cannot find ...res/'sprite'/png", delete anything before 'res/' in the path strings (I am hardpathing to let me run my project in notepad++ because my current laptop is too weak to handle IDEs FeelsBadMan), if the the error persists, message me with the error and I'll take a look.
