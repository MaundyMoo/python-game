Game TODO List
Mechanics / Gameplay - Immediate concerns
    Tile collision 
    Add a camera
    Add a second test scene to test transition between gameplay scenes (outdoors => indoors), 
    as I know that level to level transition should be fairly smooth as I don't need to transfer
    level information between them
    Move scenes to their own files
Design / Art / Story - Secondary concerns
    Decide on resolution
    Decide on art size / art direction
    Music
        Royalty free or original 'compositions'
        sound effects
        music direction (dependant on overall art / narrative direction)
            If I ever get so far as to be able to worry about artistic direction
            Finishing the framework (even with pygame powering it) will most likely take a 
            very long time, I don't really know what I'm doing
User QOL - Final concerns
    Custom control configurations
