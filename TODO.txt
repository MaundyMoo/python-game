Game TODO List
Mechanics / Gameplay
    Replace inefficient tile logic with a background and have collisions occur between objects rather than tiles
        Or try to optimise by only redrawing tiles near the player
        Method
        -First frame, draw everything tile on the map
        -For every other frame, get the position of the player and relate that to the tile grid
        -Draw the tiles near the player
    Add a camera
    Add a second test scene to test transition between gameplay scenes (outdoors => indoors)
